Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I will be on leave from Saturday, December 2nd, to Wednesday, December 6th. During this time, I will be away from my laptop and may not be able to respond promptly to emails or messages.

Please feel free to reach out to [Backup Contact/Team Member's Name] if anything urgent arises. I will ensure to address any pending tasks before my leave and catch up on anything upon my return.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Sampath
